# Book-Review-SentimentAnalysis

Performing sentiment analysis on book data to find out wheather review is positive, negative or neutral. Tried Different models like svm, decision tree, logistice regression etc. svm out performed all the other algorithms but Sequential model have a greater accuracy to do the task.
Gaining from the project:
 1. Learned about two different vectorization techniques (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)
 2. Learned about GridSearch for automatic hyperparameter tuning (really helpful)
 3. state of art models can improve the model further and make our work more easy in the NLP realm.
